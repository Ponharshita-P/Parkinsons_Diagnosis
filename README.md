# Parkinsons_Diagnosis
A Exploratory Data Analysis and Model building process that uses voice signals dataset identifies significant vocal features and builds a reliable predictive model. We provide a non-invasive and accurate diagnosis that enables early intervention & improves patient outcomes.

The dataset used in this project is from Kaggle data bank. The dataset has 24 columns, thus we need to reduce the dimension before we train the data. The target or independent variable is "status" with binary values of 0 and 1. Status values for healthy person and PD person are 0 and 1 respectively. This is a classification probelm. The goal of this project is to develop the best machine learning model to predict the Parkinson's disease so that we can treat the patient in the timely manner.
